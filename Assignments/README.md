# Assignment Programs

**Do not rename the folders in this section. If you do, you will lose marks.**

The folders for ``Task1`` and ``Task2`` contain "stubs" of Python programs, to indicate how you should name your own solutions. You should use these names, and no others. 

**If you change the names, you will lose marks.**

The ``Task2`` folder also contains three sample input files for your convenience. *These are not the sample files used in the specification document.*

The names you should give the programs in ``Task3`` are obvious. They should be the names of the commands implemented.
