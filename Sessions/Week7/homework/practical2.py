#Practical 2 - Three Functions
"""
Write and test three functions that each take two words (strings) as parameters and
return sorted lists (as defined above) representing respectively:
Letters that appear in at least one of the two words.
Letters that appear in both words.
Letters that appear in either word, but not in both.

Hint: These could all be done programmatically, but consider carefully what topic we
have been discussing this week! Each function can be exactly one line.
