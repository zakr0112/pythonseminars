#Practical 1 - Unix nl (CLA Implementation)
"""
The Unix nl command prints the lines of a text file with a line number at the start
of each line. (It can be useful when printing out programs for 
dry runs or white-box testing).

Write an implementation of this command. It should take the name of the
files as a command-line argument
