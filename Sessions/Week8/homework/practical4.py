#Practical 4 - Unix wc command (CLA Implementation)
"""
The Unix wc command counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file.
Write an implementation of this that takes a file name as a command-line
argument, and then prints the number of lines and characters.
Note: Linux (and Mac) users can use the "wc" command to check the results of their
implementation.
