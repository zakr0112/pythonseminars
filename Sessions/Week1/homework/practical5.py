#Practical 5 - Divide into labs
"""
The Head of Computing at the University of Poppleton is tasked with dividing a
group of students into lab groups. A lab group is 24 students, since this is the
number of PCs in a lab. Write a program that calculates how many groups are
needed for the following number of students: 113, 175, 12. Display how many full
groups there will be, and how many students will be in the smaller "left over"
group

students2 = 175
students3 = 12

one = students1 / lab
print("1:", one)

two = students2 / lab
print("1:", two)
